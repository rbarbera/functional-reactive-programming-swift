# Notes

- There's a set of libraries that simplify working with Reactive in Swift. In this book we'll show the examples based on **ReactiveCocoa** but everything learnt here can be applied with other libraries like for example **RXSwift**
- Explained concepts can also be applied in other programming languages. Once you understand what's Reactive the difference is the syntax and the API that your framework offers.
- It's difficult to understand Reactive without functional concepts, i.e., **Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)**. This book will address some functional concepts so if you're not familiar with them at all, I recommend you to read the book [**Functional Programming in Swift**](https://www.objc.io/books/) by *Chris Eidhof, Florian Kugler, and Wouter Swierstra*.
- Although you'll find  most of the Reactive concepts on internet. The method of this book is based on:
  - **Examples carefully designed** in most of the chapters.
	- **Linking with real problems, use cases** that show the sense of using Reactive on situations that we've to face daily as a developers.

- All the examples included in this book will be available on this [repository](https://github.com/pepibumur/functional-reactive-programming-swift) where you'll find the book written in Markdown so you can propose improvements, fix mistakes or even add new examples. Any direct contributor will have an special mention in the book expressing thanks for its contribution.
- Any *"bug"* found in the book can be directly reported as a PR to the repository or sent directly by email to the email address [pepibumur@gmail.com](mailto://pepibumur@gmail.com)
